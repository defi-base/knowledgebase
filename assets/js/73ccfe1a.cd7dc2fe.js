We will share our ideas & progress here. The reason for it\'s existence is to allow other people to **quickly pickup** on our current work and contribute more easily. It is our own little crypto world.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nWe have **2 main sections** in the Knowledgebase:\\n- [Current Progress](#current-progress)\\n- [Thoughts & Discussions](#thoughts--discussions)\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Current Progress\\n\\nCurrent progress will elaborate on the **current state** of our work. It will be a **collection of articles** that will explain the **current state** of our work. These articles will be divided into categories, with some brief explanations, analysis and more. You will be able to find some code snippets and pseudo code there as well.\\n\\nExample:\\n- Category: **Simulations**\\n  - Article: **Simulating the deployment of the token**\\n  - Article: **Simulating the buys & sells**\\n  - Article: **Honeypots**\\n- Category: **Communities**\\n  - Article: **Discord and Telegram communities comparison**\\n  - Article: **Value of the Orbit model in telegram communities**\\n\\n\\nSome of these articles / Categories will be followed by a **simple product / bot / Proof of Concept** that will be free for use. Code shall remain closed source.\\n\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Thoughts & Discussions\\n\\nThoughts & Discussions will be a collections of **articles** and **blog posts** that will be a part of a **singular line** that we call **\\"Journey\\"**.\\n\\nFollowing the Journey, you shall be able to get a better understanding of our idea and the concept of Knowledgebase. This article is part of the Journey.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- **Journey:**\\n  - Article: **Introduction to Knowledgebase**\\n  - Article: **Cornerstones of DeFi & what keeps it afloat**\\n  - Article: **Role of community in DeFi**"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/first-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/defi-base/knowledgebase/tree/main/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
