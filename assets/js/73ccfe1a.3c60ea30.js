Areas of interest defined through the story.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThrough examples and story, we shall define the **areas of interest, key components and concepts** that DeFi Base would want to explore.\\n\\n## The Story\\n\\n### Chapters\\n- [Chapter 1 - The Swaps](#chapter-1---the-swaps)\\n- [Chapter 2 - Outside Factors](#chapter-2---outside-factors)\\n- [Chapter 3 - Areas of Interest](#chapter-3---areas-of-interest)\\n\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Chapter 1 - The Swaps\\n\\nMeet **Alice**. Alice is relatively new to crypto & ethereum ecosystem. She has intent to **perform actions on the Ethereum network**. She understands the basics of blockchain, ethereum & EVM, into detail deep enough to allow her to perform basic swaps. \\n\\n\\nShe has intentions to **buy** tokens in order to achieve a certain **monetary gain**. Her desired place to do so is **Uniswap**. (note - in this case, tokens refer to ERC20 tokens)\\n\\nTo her current understanding, at a certain time, she can **swap TokenA for TokenB**, at a certain **exchange ratio**, calculated by an algorithm that is based on the **liquidity pool** of the given token pair.\\n\\nAlice knows that other factors will influence the exchange ratio over time, such as **volume**, **liquidity**, **news**, **market sentiment** and many more. Her current goal is to achieve a certain **monetary gain** by swapping the tokens at a certain time, getting the best exchange ratio possible.\\n\\n![Alice](../static/img/blog/areas-of-interest/2023-12-29-18-49-07.png)\\n\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Chapter 2 - Outside Factors\\n\\nTo her current understanding, Alice knows that the price on uniswap is automatically calculated by an [algorithm](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/7422670207373-How-are-token-prices-determined-). \\n\\nLooking at the [picture from Chapter 1](../static/img/blog/areas-of-interest/2023-12-29-18-49-07.png), the ratio is calculated by the following formula: \\n\\n```\\nToken_A_supply * Token_B_supply = Constant\\n```\\n\\nIn which the buys and sells affect the **supply of tokens** in liquidity pool. **Constant needs to remain the same**, hence the exchange ratio between the tokens **changes** in order to keep the Constant the same.\\n\\nDeducting from this, she realizes that the change in the **price of the token** depends on the constant, the **state of the liquidity pool - (the buys and the sells)**. She realizes that information she currently has **isn\'t sufficient** for her to achieve her goal, she needs to take a step back and think about what **affects the buys and sells**.\\n\\nAlice realizes that in order to achieve her goal, she needs to have information.\\n\\n*NOTE - One could argue that certain crypto markets could be deemed inefficient while others remain efficient. Here is a link to the* [Efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis)\\n\\n#### Alice\'s obsession - the information she wants to know\\n\\nIn order to get a better understanding on what might happen, Alice would need to obtain certain information **about the token** she is interested in, as well as **the network** itself.\\n\\nAlice became a bit scared realizing how much she doesn\'t know to the point where she became obsessed with the idea of **obtaining information before she makes a decision**.\\n\\nWhile thinking about it, she came to the following conclusions.\\n- Alice wants to know the general information about the token, that would be a good starting point. **Wheres, whens, hows and whys**.\\n- Alice wants to know the current state of the token at the time of noticing it, as well as previous states that the token went through. She wants to know the **history** of the token.\\n- She, as everyone else, hopes that one day, she will be able to go back in time. Unfortunately, she knows that it is not possible, so **her best option is to guess:** \\"What would happen if she had done such and such\\"\\n- Alice knows that holders, buyers and sellers stand behind the token, other people\'s intentions are bringing value to it. She would want to somehow get to know the **people behind the token**.\\n- Noticing that people are sometimes **driven by the emotion instead of reason**, she would want to know how could that influence her actions & decisions.\\n\\nAs of now, in the context of our approach, **this is all that Alice wants to know**. Nothing else.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Chapter 3 - Areas of Interest\\n\\nFollowing Alice\'s trail of thought, we can use the following approach.\\n\\nDefining what building blocks make Alice\'s line of thinking, we can start off small, with the **Swap Entity**.\\n\\nThe **Swap Entity** itself could be broken down into the following components:\\n- **Tokens** - red & green - The tokens that are being swapped, we could explore the swaps with multiple tokens (3 etc.)\\n- **Liquidity Pool** - blue - The liquidity pool that is being used for the swap\\n- **Swap Action** - organge - The action of swapping the tokens itself\\n\\nThe **Swap Entity** as shown in the image below.\\n\\n![Areas of Interest](../static/img/blog/areas-of-interest/2023-12-30-00-43-47.png)\\n\\nWe can say that the **Swap Entity** (Tokens, LPs and Swap Action) is the **core** of our journey and our **primary area of interest** as of now. Information originating from the sources of influence on the Swap Entity is also of interest. Being able to obtain such information would be of great help to Alice. That would be the **secondary area of interest - information gathering**. Taking a step away, and looking at the whole ethereum & defi ecosystem, we can say that the Swap Entity and it\'s components should be analized in bigger sample groups. That would define our **tertiary area of interest** -> Big Data collected over time.\\n\\nLike every human being, Alice is also prone to curiosity. Being able to obtain & analyze such information and then reproduce it in a controlled environment, and being able to, with certain degree of certainty, predict the outcome, would be of great help to Alice. That would be the **quaternary area of interest - Simulations**.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n- Swap Entity - swap action, tokens, liquidity pool etc.\\n- Information Gathering - information about the network, people, communities etc.\\n- Big Data - Monitoring the network, capturing tokens, indexing them etc.\\n- Simulations - Allows us to reproduce the outcomes of the mentioned 3 areas of interest.\\n\\nMore on these topics would be elaborated in the future articles."},{"id":"introduction","metadata":{"permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/introduction","editUrl":"https://github.com/defi-base/knowledgebase/tree/master/blog/2023-12-28-Introduction.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-28-Introduction.md","title":"Introduction to Knowledgebase","description":"The explanation of the idea behind the Knowledgebase, how things will work around here etc. This is a good starting point for everyone.","date":"2023-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"overview","permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/tags/overview"},{"label":"introduction","permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/tags/introduction"},{"label":"idea","permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/tags/idea"}],"readingTime":1.58,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luka Radisavljevic","title":"DeFi base Engineer","url":"https://github.com/madjarx","imageURL":"https://github.com/madjarx.png","key":"madjar"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introduction","title":"Introduction to Knowledgebase","authors":"madjar","tags":["overview","introduction","idea"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Areas of Interest - The Story of Alice","permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/areas-of-interest"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Blog Post","permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"The explanation of the **idea** behind the Knowledgebase, how things will work around here etc. This is a **good starting point** for everyone. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is Knowledgebase?\\n\\nKnowledgebase is essentially an **aggregator of research & development** done by our small community. We will share our ideas & progress here. The reason for it\'s existence is to allow other people to **quickly pickup** on our current work and contribute more easily. It is our own little crypto world.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nWe have **2 main sections** in the Knowledgebase:\\n- [Current Progress](#current-progress)\\n- [Thoughts & Discussions](#thoughts--discussions)\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Current Progress\\n\\nCurrent progress will elaborate on the **current state** of our work. It will be a **collection of articles** that will explain the **current state** of our work. These articles will be divided into categories, with some brief explanations, analysis and more. You will be able to find some code snippets and pseudo code there as well.\\n\\nExample:\\n- Category: **Simulations**\\n  - Article: **Simulating the deployment of the token**\\n  - Article: **Simulating the buys & sells**\\n  - Article: **Honeypots**\\n- Category: **Communities**\\n  - Article: **Discord and Telegram communities comparison**\\n  - Article: **Value of the Orbit model in telegram communities**\\n\\n\\nSome of these articles / Categories will be followed by a **simple product / bot / Proof of Concept** that will be free for use. Code shall remain closed source.\\n\\n\\n---\\n---\\n### Thoughts & Discussions\\n\\nThoughts & Discussions will be a collections of **articles** and **blog posts** that will be a part of a **singular line** that we call **\\"Journey\\"**.\\n\\nFollowing the Journey, you shall be able to get a better understanding of our idea and the concept of Knowledgebase. This article is part of the Journey.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- **Journey:**\\n  - Article: **Introduction to Knowledgebase**\\n  - Article: **Cornerstones of DeFi & what keeps it afloat**\\n  - Article: **Role of community in DeFi**"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/knowledgebase/blog/first-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/defi-base/knowledgebase/tree/master/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
