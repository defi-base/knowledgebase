The explanation of the **idea** behind the Knowledgebase, how things will work around here etc. This is a **good starting point** for everyone.

## What is Knowledgebase?

Knowledgebase is essentially an **aggregator of research & development** done by our small community. We will share our ideas & progress here. The reason for it's existence is to allow other people to **quickly pickup** on our current work and contribute more easily. It is our own little crypto world.

## How does it work?

We have **2 main sections** in the Knowledgebase:
- Current Progress
- Thoughts & Discussions

### Current Progress

Current progress will elaborate on the **current state** of our work. It will be a **collection of articles** that will explain the **current state** of our work. These articles will be divided into categories, with some brief explanations, analysis and more. You will be able to find some code snippets and pseudo code there as well.

Example:
- Category: **Simulations**
  - Article: **Simulating the deployment of the token**
  - Article: **Simulating the buys & sells**
  - Article: **Honeypots**
- Category: **Communities**
  - Article: **Discord and Telegram communities comparison**
  - Article: **Value of the Orbit model in telegram communities**


Some of these articles / Categories will be followed by a **simple product / bot / Proof of Concept** that will be free for use. Code shall remain closed source.
